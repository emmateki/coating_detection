# Coating Detection

The goal of this project was to preprocess the given data and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model with Unet architecture to detect the coating layer on new images.

## Project Overview

### 1. Problem Definition
- **Non-existing Dataset**: The original dataset did not exist in a usable format, so we had to create one:
  - Masks were generated by plotting polygons based on ROI lines.
  - A custom K-Means algorithm was developed to assist in labeling.
  - The process was refined through collaboration with scientists to ensure accuracy.

### 2. Model Development
- **Augmentation**: Various data augmentation techniques were employed.
- **Data Splitting**: The dataset was split into training, validation, and test.
- **Optimization**: Hyperparameters were optimized using Optuna.

### 3. Integration with Fiji
- **Shell Commands**: Integration of the model into Fiji (ImageJ).
